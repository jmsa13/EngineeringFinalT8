# Description
This is our final project utilizing a GUI library **PySide6**, Data Science library **pandas**,
and **Matplotlib** to plot the data onto the GUI to showcase cybersecurity cloud breaches of 
major companies, and countries.
* There are 5 tabs, each corresponding to a specific cloud breach
* Within these corresponding tabs are graphs that showcase our findings of these breaches
* The GUI is moveable and all buttons are highlightable utilizing CSS styling
