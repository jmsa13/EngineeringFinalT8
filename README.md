# Engineering 1100 Final Project
* Auburn University Intro to Engineering

## Description
This is our final project utilizing a GUI library **PySide6**, Data Science library **pandas**,
and **Matplotlib** to plot the data onto the GUI to showcase cybersecurity cloud breaches of 
major companies, and countries.
* There are 5 tabs, each corresponding to a specific cloud breach
* Within these corresponding tabs are graphs that showcase our findings of these breaches
* The GUI is moveable and all buttons are highlightable utilizing CSS styling

## How to Run
There are two dependencies needed to run this program:
1. PySide6
2. Pandas

- pip install PySide6
- pip install Pandas

You can run the program through the command line or through an IDE,
* CMD> python Main.py or >py Main.py
* IDE> run the main program inside your ide (*make sure you have dependencies installed*)
